                    I've spent a lot of time at school, like <i>a lot</i>. While I was at school I worked part time doing software to help feed my growing family. That led to a mixed background of academia and software.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Born in <b>1988</b>, I grew up in Page, AZ and graduated from Page 
                            High School in <b>2006</b>. A brief stint at University of Arizona 
                            and then a 2-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
                            Saints speaking Mandarin Chinese in Melbourne Australia. 
                            This concluded in <b>2009</b>.

                            and Master's degrees in physics. Part time doing Drupal and Ruby 
                            on Rails.

                            Distributed systems. I was focused on writing scientific applications of
                            our distributed compute protocol (DCP). During the pandemic I worked closely
                            with the epidemiologists from Queen's University tasked with modeling COVID
                            and providing data to the provincial decision makers.

                            I've gone from helping build quantum computers by providing software that 
                            controls scientific instruments, to leading and architecting software projects
                            and programs that have touched almost every part of the software stack from
                            low-level pulse programming to front-end heavy web-based GUIs and infrastructure.
