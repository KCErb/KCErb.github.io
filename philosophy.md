I once had a fellow physics graduate student ask me: who's your favorite philosopher? I was somewhat taken aback. My favorite what? His idea was that since I'm getting a PhD, a Doctorate of Philosophy, I should know something about the field and would presumably have some opinions on the topic such as which philosopher I liked best.

Since then I've taken his challenge to heart and tried to do some justice to that part of my nascent degree. I've spent many odd hours writing down my approaches to fundamental topics like [epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology), [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology), [interpretations of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics), and the [problem of induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction). In the future I will post my musings in philosophy here but for now the reader will just have to wait.
