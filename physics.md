  Right now I'm a graduate student at the University of Utah studying physics and
  generally having a pretty good time.
</p>

 In contrast to the comic, I actually have met a lot of great academics here including my current
 advisor [Ed DiBella](http://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/mddetail.php?facultyID=u0030685). In our lab we are working to improve MRI technologies related to image reconstruction. I've been investigating a "re-gridding" method called [GROG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18383296) in relation to interpolating non-Cartesian data onto a Cartesian grid prior to iterative [compressed sensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing) reconstruction, and recently got to present a poster at the last ISMRM (International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine) about it:

Two of the figures in my presentation were GIFs so I [put them online](http://www.ucair.med.utah.edu/erb/) to accompany the poster.

Before my time here at the U, I was an undergraduate at BYU and worked with two research groups. I've always held a dual interest in medicine and physics so with the one group I learned X-ray crystallography and with the other I learned about Proteomics.

### Future Plans

Right now I do physics full-time and I code for fun, but I hope in the future to reverse that and obtain a full-time job programming so that I can conduct my own research without worrying about the "fundability" of my work. My plan for attaining that end is to attach myself to a university as an auxiliary professor.

In that arrangement, I am attached to a research group at the university and agree to do a few hours of research a week with them. The university has no financial obligation towards me, so instead, they offer me access to their library system / journal subscriptions. In the meantime, I put my love of programming to work bringing home the bacon.

The end result is that I mostly spend my days programming and thinking up new ideas in physics. When I publish, the university gets to have their name on my papers and my employer gets to say he has a publishing PhD-toting physicist on the team. That's a win-win-win.
