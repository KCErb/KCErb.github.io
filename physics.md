<p class="lead">
  I'm a graduate student at Charles University studying physics and
  generally having a pretty good time.
</p>

Right now I'm transitioning from my Master's degree focus (MRI research) to more theoretical endeavors. I'm splitting my time about 50/50 between my advisor's work in group-theoretical approaches to understanding ferroic phase transitions ([Phys. Rev. Let.](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.177602)), and my own ideas in something that I call physical algebra ([2017 March Meeting](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR17/Session/T1.266)).

Before switching to theoretical physics, I was doing research in the field of magnetic resonance imaging and before that I was an undergraduate at BYU and worked with two research groups. I've always held a dual interest in medicine and physics so with the one group I learned X-ray crystallography and with the other I learned about Proteomics. Below you'll see a short summary of the three papers I've helped author.
