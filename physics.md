  I'm a graduate student at the University of Utah studying physics and
  generally having a pretty good time.
</p>

Right now I'm transitioning from my Master's degree focus (MRI research) to more theoretical endeavors. During this period, I'm doing research on my own time, paying the bills with programming, and actively seeking to form a new Ph.D. committee centered on developing a framework that I call physical algebra. It's still a work in progress and I've got a long way to go but I'll be presenting what I've got so far at the [2017 APS March Meeting](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR17/Session/T1.266). Though my current committee chair, Brian Saam, is supportive of the work, he has recommended that I form a new committee and that I not limit my search to the University of Utah. My hope is that at this conference I can get a professor somewhere as excited as I am about the prospects of Physical Algebra and turn this project into Ph.D. thesis.

Before switching to theoretical physics, I was doing research in the field of magnetic resonance imaging and before that I was an undergraduate at BYU and worked with two research groups. I've always held a dual interest in medicine and physics so with the one group I learned X-ray crystallography and with the other I learned about Proteomics.
